- 👋 Hi, I’m @sumake0
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python from beginner to a level able to handle beginning natural language processsing--though not for employment but for doctoral work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning from Hammond Py for Linguists and TiesdeKok's course
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone at the infant stage with the NLP goal.
- 📫 How to reach me no idea other than csulatesol2021@gmail.com.
